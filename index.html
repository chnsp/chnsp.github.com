        <h2>Exploration.   Education.   Camaraderie.</h2>
        <p>
The Cottage Home Near Space Program's goal, above all, is to send spacecraft into near space to conduct interesting experiments, collect data, and take
pictures of outer space and Earth. A natural component of this is education and
spreading knowledge on many different levels.  We are big proponents of 
open source software and hardware, and on that level it is our goal to make as many
of our projects as possible reproducible, with free documentation that can be used by and 
expanded on by others.  Last but not least, the CHNS Program is about having fun 
hanging out and building projects with other people and communities on both a 
local and global scale.

        <h2>Balulu</h2>
        <p><img width="200px" src="/images/balulu1.jpg" />
Balulu is our first back-to-basics balloon-based near space craft. Built on
Arduino and featuring an onboard GPS, Balulu will communicate with our     
base station via AX.25 Packet Radio. More information, including specs and launch
party details, coming in September 2011.
        </p>
        <h2>Packet Radio Renewal</h2>
        <p><img width="200px" src="/images/packet1.jpg" />
Despite its limited bandwidth, packet radio is a great solution for distributed
message sending, such as emergency communications, Twitter-style messages, etc.
Due to its low power and infrastructure requirements, it can play an important role in disaster situations and other times when cell phone towers and the internet backbone may be unreliable.
        </p>
        <p>
We believe the time is ripe for a renewal in hobbyist Packet Radio.  While
Packet Radio is nothing new, and there are vast resources for it on the internet,
we think it's too hard for the new user to get set up and started.  The goal
for this project is to develop a set of completely open source schematics, code,
and documentation for getting started quickly, as well as to provide easy to install packages
for Ubuntu Linux and other operating platforms.
        </p>
        <h2>Research and Design</h2>
        <p>
Research, design, and spin-off projects have always been important components 
of traditional space programs and the CHNS Program is no exception. In addition to
Phase II balloons and rockets, we hope to foster and develop other interesting projects in the
neighborhood.

        <h2>Chris Hartley</h2>
        <p><img width="200px" src="/images/chris2.jpg" />
Originally from Georgia, Chris got interested in electronics as a kid with 
a Radio Shack 50 in 1 projects kit. He went to Beloit College and has a B.A. in
Political Science. Along with his wife Annie, Chris has traveled the globe 
and worked on a number of socially engaging projects ranging from installing small-scale solar power stations
in Tanzania to working with Common Ground Relief in New Orleans after
Hurricane Katrina.
</p>
<p>
Chris currently works in the nonprofit field of International Education. In 
addition to soldering and Adruino hacking, Chris is an avid arugula farmer and is
studying to become an EMT. Balulu, one of Chris and Annie's adopted cats from
New Orleans, is the inspiration and name for our first near space balloon.

        <h2>Steven Githens</h2>
        <p><img width="200px" src="/images/steve1.jpg" />
Steve grew up in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and has Computer Science and
Bioinformatics degrees from Michigan Tech. Since discovering Linux his freshman
year, he's become an ardent open source software evangelist and has spent the
past 5 years hacking open software stacks for education at Northwestern 
University, the University of Cambridge, Indiana University and other places.
        </p>
        <p>
After several years in Chicago, Steve moved to Indianapolis and more recently
to Cottage Home.  One night while working on an Asterisk-based PBX with Chris, 
Chris brought up the idea of building an Arduino-based weather balloon. Needless
to say, no work has gotten done on the PBX since. 
In addition to working on open source software, Steve is involved in various
forms of progressive activism and enjoys long-distance triathlon training.

        <h2>Mike Lyons</h2>
        <p><img width="200px" src="/images/mike1.jpg" />
Mike is the resident CHNS Program Industrial Design Engineer, and has the carbon fiber skills (learned in a brief stint on gasoline alley making Indy car parts) and design sensibilities to create both dependable and aesthetically pleasing near space craft.  For the Balulu mission, he is designing and building the chassis to safely house the avionics.
        </p>
        <p>
Mike and his wife Adrian have lived in CH for the last three years, first as renting fianc√©'s now as married home-owning parents of beautiful baby boy ARLO. Mike stays at home with Arlo during the day and makes cool things in the evening at his shop/studio at the north end of the neighborhood. His interests include contemporary art and digital fabrication technologies.  Mike studied at the 
IUPUI Herron School of Art and Design where he has a B.F.A. in Sculpture.

        <h2>About Cottage Home</h2>
        <p><img width="200px" src="/images/cottagehome1.jpg" />
Nestled in Indianapolis's near east side between Mass Ave and Arsenal Tech High
School, Cottage Home and its surrounding neighborhoods are teeming with artists,
tinkerers, urban farmers, and in general tons of great camaraderie. All of this makes
it a great place to live, and a natural location in which to base a space program.
